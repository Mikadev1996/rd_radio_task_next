Q) What libraries did you add to the application? What are they used for?

    Developed using the Next.js framework which uses React. 
    Sass is also installed however almost all of the styles written is compatible with standard css.

Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

    next build
    next start

General
Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

    One key thing I would add is testing, I have previously briefly used Jest to test front-end projects so I would use that.
    The styling is also very minimal and did not improve on the given design so I would improve on that given more time.
    The page doesn't also respond well when it is resized so that is something I would further develop.

Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
    
    Getting the play / pause function working with the audio tag as I haven't used the audio tag before in a project. It was satisying to get the audio aspect working correctly.

Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

    Initally I found just getting the data from the website confusing. 
    I spent time looking for a way to fetch the artist name/ song picture from the website directly.
    I ended up just grabbing the URLs for the images and text for artist/song names directly and putting it into the array of data.

    Outside of getting the data I don't believe I struggled too much on developing the app, thought I did spend some time
    considering how to structure the components.
    
Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

    It was a unique and a fun challenge that helped me practice my use of React/Next!
